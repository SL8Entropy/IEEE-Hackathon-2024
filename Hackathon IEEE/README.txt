# Audio Transcription and Grammar Correction

## Overview
This application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for transcribing audio files and correcting the grammar of the transcribed text. It utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate audio transcription and a T5 model for grammar correction.

## Features
- **Browse for Audio Files**: Select audio files in formats such as WAV, MP3, or FLAC.
- **Transcription**: Convert audio to text using the Whisper model.
- **Grammar Correction**: Improve the grammar of the transcribed text using a T5 model.
- **Progress Monitoring**: View the status and progress of transcription and grammar correction.
- **Export**: Save the corrected text to a text file.
- **Reset**: Clear the current session and reset the application.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries: `tkinter`, `openai-whisper`, `pydub`, `torch`, `transformers`
- Whisper model: Automatically downloaded when using the Whisper library
- T5 model: Automatically downloaded when using the Transformers library

## Installation
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the source code from the repository.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter openai-whisper pydub torch transformers
   ```
3. **Prepare the Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary audio processing tools and libraries.

## Usage
1. **Run the Application**: Execute the script to start the GUI:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```
2. **Browse for Audio File**: Click the "Browse Audio File" button and select an audio file.
3. **Transcribe and Correct**: Click the "Transcribe and Correct" button to process the audio.
4. **Export Corrected Text**: After grammar correction is complete, click the "Export Corrected Text" button to save the corrected text.
5. **Reset**: Use the "Reset" button to clear the current session and prepare for a new file.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Whisper model and T5 model files are properly downloaded and available.
- The application provides progress updates during processing, and text display is limited to 20 words for brevity.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error in Loading Models**: Verify that you have a stable internet connection for downloading models.
- **Audio File Issues**: Ensure that the audio file is in a supported format and not corrupted.
- **Performance**: For faster processing, use a machine with GPU support.
